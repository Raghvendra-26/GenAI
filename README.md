# From Python Foundations to Applied GenAI 🚀

This repository documents my structured learning journey where I am **revisiting and strengthening Python programming fundamentals** as a deliberate step toward becoming a **job-ready Applied Generative AI Developer**.

The focus is on **learning by building**, developing strong logical thinking, and writing clean, reusable code before moving into advanced GenAI systems.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Journey
- Strengthen core programming fundamentals
- Think and solve problems like a software engineer
- Build real, hands-on projects from Day 1
- Develop confidence in writing structured code
- Transition into Applied Generative AI roles
- Be interview-ready with strong fundamentals

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy
- Project-first approach
- Intentional revision of fundamentals
- Focus on logic, clarity, and code structure
- One concept → one project
- Strong foundations before GenAI tools
- Consistent progress tracked via GitHub

---
