# From Python Foundations to Applied GenAI 🚀

This repository documents my structured learning journey as I strengthen my **Python programming fundamentals** and progress toward becoming a **job-ready Applied Generative AI Developer**.

The focus is on **learning by building**, revisiting core concepts intentionally, and developing strong problem-solving and coding confidence before moving deeper into GenAI systems.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Journey
- Strengthen core programming fundamentals
- Think and solve problems like a software engineer
- Build real, hands-on projects from Day 1
- Transition into Applied Generative AI roles
- Be interview-ready with strong logic and system understanding

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy
- Project-first approach
- Concepts revised intentionally for clarity
- Focus on logic, readability, and confidence
- Strong foundations before advanced GenAI tools
- Consistent progress documented via code
