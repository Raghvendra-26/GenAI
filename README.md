# From Python Foundations to Applied GenAI 🚀

This repository documents my structured learning journey where I am **revisiting and strengthening Python programming fundamentals** as a deliberate step toward becoming a **job-ready Applied Generative AI Developer**.

The focus is on **deep understanding, clean code, and project-first learning**, ensuring strong foundations before moving into advanced GenAI systems such as LLMs, RAG, and AI agents.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Journey
- Strengthen core programming fundamentals
- Think and solve problems like a software engineer
- Write clean, reusable, and structured Python code
- Build real, hands-on projects from Day 1
- Develop confidence in problem solving and logic
- Transition into Applied Generative AI roles
- Be interview-ready with strong fundamentals and projects

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy
- Learn by building, not memorizing
- Revise fundamentals intentionally and deeply
- Focus on **why** concepts exist, not just **how**
- One responsibility per function
- Data-first and logic-first design
- Strong foundations before GenAI abstractions
- Consistent progress tracked via GitHub

## 📅 Study Progress

### ✅ Day 1 – Programming Mindset & Python Basics
**Concepts Covered:**
- How computers think
- Input → Process → Output model
- Python `print()`
- Variables
- User input

**Mini Project:**
- Greeting Generator  
  (Takes user details and prints a personalized introduction)

---

### ✅ Day 2 – Data Types & Decision Making
**Concepts Covered:**
- Data types (`int`, `float`, `str`)
- Type casting
- Mathematical operations
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Comparison operators

**Mini Project:**
- Smart Age Analyzer  
  (Classifies users based on age using decision logic)

---

### ✅ Day 3 – Loops & Program Flow Control
**Concepts Covered:**
- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- Loop conditions
- `break` statement
- Program flow control

**Mini Project:**
- Number Guessing Game  
  (Uses loops and conditionals to control game execution)

---

### ✅ Day 4 – Functions & Modular Programming
**Concepts Covered:**
- Why functions exist
- Defining and calling functions
- Parameters and arguments
- Return values
- Functions with logic and loops
- Recursion (factorial)
- Writing reusable and modular code

**Mini Projects / Exercises:**
- Utility Toolkit (menu-driven program using functions)

- Factorial using recursion

---

### ✅ Day 5 – Data Structures (Lists & Tuples)
**Concepts Covered:**
- What data structures are and why they matter
- Lists: creation, indexing, looping, modification
- Lists with functions
- Input validation and edge-case handling
- Tuples and immutability
- Data-driven program design

**Mini Projects / Exercises:**
- Student Management System (list-based, menu-driven)
- Find minimum and maximum from a list
