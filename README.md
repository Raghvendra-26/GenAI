# From Python Foundations to Applied GenAI 🚀

This repository documents my structured learning journey where I am **revisiting and strengthening Python programming fundamentals** with depth and clarity, as a deliberate step toward becoming a **job-ready Applied Generative AI Engineer**.

The focus is on **thinking in data structures, writing clean logic, and building real systems**, rather than rushing into tools without strong foundations.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Journey
- Build strong Python fundamentals with real understanding
- Think and solve problems like a software engineer
- Model real-world data using proper data structures
- Write clean, reusable, and testable code
- Prepare for backend, API, and Applied GenAI roles
- Be interview-ready with strong fundamentals and projects

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy
- Learn concepts **deeply**, not superficially
- Always understand:
  - What data exists
  - How it should be structured
  - What operation needs to be performed
- Project-first and logic-first learning
- One responsibility per function
- Strong foundations before advanced GenAI abstractions
- Consistent progress tracked via GitHub
