# From Python Foundations to Applied GenAI 🚀

This repository documents my structured learning journey where I am **revisiting and strengthening Python fundamentals deeply and correctly**, with a clear goal of transitioning into **backend and Applied Generative AI engineering**.

The focus is not on rushing tools, but on:
- Understanding how programs actually work
- Modeling real-world data
- Writing persistent, structured systems
- Building habits used in production software

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Journey
- Build strong Python fundamentals with clarity
- Think like a software engineer, not just a coder
- Understand data structures and program lifecycle
- Prepare for backend, APIs, and GenAI systems
- Become job-ready through real problem-solving

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy
- Depth over speed
- Understand **what**, **how**, and **why**
- Learn by building and iterating
- Make mistakes and fix them deliberately
- Strong foundations before advanced abstractions
- Every concept tied to real systems

---

## 📅 Study Progress

---

### ✅ Day 1 – Programming Mindset & Python Basics
**Concepts Covered:**
- How programs think (Input → Process → Output)
- `print()`, variables
- User input

**Mini Project:**
- Greeting Generator

---

### ✅ Day 2 – Data Types & Conditional Logic
**Concepts Covered:**
- Data types (`int`, `float`, `str`)
- Type casting
- Arithmetic operations
- Conditional statements

**Mini Project:**
- Smart Age Analyzer

---

### ✅ Day 3 – Loops & Flow Control
**Concepts Covered:**
- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- Loop conditions
- `break`

**Mini Project:**
- Number Guessing Game

---

### ✅ Day 4 – Functions & Modular Programming
**Concepts Covered:**
- Function definition and calls
- Parameters and return values
- Writing reusable logic
- Recursion basics

**Exercises / Mini Projects:**
- Prime number checker
- Factorial using recursion
- Utility-based programs using functions

---

### ✅ Day 5 – Lists, Tuples & Data-Driven Programs
**Concepts Covered:**
- Lists and indexing
- Looping over lists
- Lists with functions
- Tuples and immutability
- Program design using data structures

**Mini Projects / Exercises:**
- Student Marks System
- Min/Max finder

---

### ✅ Day 6 – Dictionaries & Real-World Data Modeling
**Concepts Covered:**
- Dictionaries (key → value)
- Safe access using `.get()`
- Looping through dictionaries
- Lists of dictionaries
- Modeling real-world entities (similar to JSON)

**Assignments / Mini Projects:**
- User type checker (Adult / Minor)
- Inventory value calculation
- User Profile Manager (in-memory)

---

### ✅ Day 7 – File Handling & JSON Persistence
**Concepts Covered:**
- File handling (`open`, `read`, `write`, `close`)
- Why persistence is required
- JSON as structured data storage
- `json.dump()` and `json.load()`
- Program lifecycle (load → modify → save)
- Limitations of naive file handling

**Mini Projects / Assignments:**
- Persistent User Profile Manager
- Marks system with JSON persistence
- Product Inventory Manager with:
  - Product storage
  - Inventory value calculation
  - Saving and loading data from JSON files

**Key Learning Outcome:**
- Programs that remember data across runs
- Understanding why robustness and error handling are required

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (So Far)
- Python 🐍
- Git & GitHub
- JSON (data persistence)

---

## 📌 Upcoming Topics
- Error handling (`try / except`)
- Handling missing files safely
- Input validation
- Making programs crash-proof
- Backend-style defensive programming
- APIs and structured data exchange
- Applied Generative AI fundamentals

---
