# From Python Foundations to Applied GenAI 🚀

This repository documents my **intentional upskilling journey** as a Computer Science graduate, focused on building **strong programming foundations and engineering discipline** as preparation for backend and **Applied Generative AI roles**.

The goal is not speed or tool-chasing, but:
- Understanding how programs actually behave
- Designing systems that handle failure gracefully
- Building reliable, persistent software
- Developing habits used in real production systems

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Journey
- Strengthen Python fundamentals deeply
- Think in terms of systems, not scripts
- Build crash-resistant programs
- Prepare for backend development and GenAI pipelines
- Become job-ready through deliberate practice and projects

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy
- Depth over speed  
- Project-first learning  
- Understand *what*, *how*, and *why*  
- Fail intentionally, then fix correctly  
- Focus on robustness before complexity  
- Write code that survives real-world usage  

---

- Number Guessing Game

---

### ✅ Day 4 – Functions & Modular Programming
**Concepts Covered:**
- Function definition and invocation
- Parameters and return values
- Reusable logic
- Recursion basics

**Exercises / Mini Projects:**
- Prime number checker
- Factorial using recursion
- Utility-based functions

---

### ✅ Day 5 – Lists, Tuples & Data-Driven Programs
**Concepts Covered:**
- Lists and indexing
- Iterating over collections
- Tuples and immutability
- Menu-driven program design

**Mini Projects:**
- Student Marks System
- Min/Max Finder

---

### ✅ Day 6 – Dictionaries & Real-World Data Modeling
**Concepts Covered:**
- Dictionaries (`key → value`)
- Safe access using `.get()`
- Looping through dictionaries
- Lists of dictionaries
- Modeling real-world entities (JSON-like thinking)

**Mini Projects:**
- Adult/Minor user classifier
- Inventory value calculator
- In-memory User Profile Manager

---

### ✅ Day 7 – File Handling & JSON Persistence
**Concepts Covered:**
- File handling (`open`, `read`, `write`, `close`)
- Program persistence
- JSON as structured storage
- `json.dump()` and `json.load()`
- Program lifecycle (load → modify → save)
- Limitations of naive file handling

**Mini Projects:**
- Persistent User Profile Manager
- Marks system with JSON storage
- Product Inventory Manager with file persistence

**Key Learning Outcome:**
- Programs that remember data across executions
- Understanding why robustness is required

---

### ✅ Day 8 – Error Handling & Defensive Programming
**Concepts Covered:**
- Why programs crash
- Python exception model
- `try / except` deep understanding
- Handling:
  - Missing files
  - Corrupted JSON
  - Invalid user input
- Flow control after failure
- Designing crash-resistant programs

**Upgraded Systems (Day 7 → Day 8):**
- User Profile Manager (fully robust)
- Marks System (fully robust)
- Product Inventory Manager (fully robust)

**Key Learning Outcome:**
- Writing programs that assume failure and recover safely
- Engineering mindset over syntax knowledge

---

### ✅ Day 9 – Refactoring & Code Organization
**Concepts Covered:**
- Why large scripts don’t scale
- Refactoring without changing behavior
- Separating concerns:
  - Main execution logic
  - Business logic
  - Storage/persistence
- Avoiding global state
- Writing import-safe modules
- Passing data explicitly instead of relying on shared state

**Practice:**
- Refactored User Profile Manager into multiple modules
- Refactored Marks system into clean, reusable components

**Key Learning Outcome:**
- Understanding how real codebases are structured
- Thinking in terms of maintainability, not just correctness

---

### ✅ Day 10 – Command Line Interfaces & Argument Parsing
**Concepts Covered:**
- How command-line programs actually work
- Understanding `sys.argv` deeply
- Difference between:
  - Script name
  - Commands
  - Flags and values
- Manual flag parsing (from first principles)
- Validating required flags
- Safe type conversion from CLI input
- Designing non-interactive, automation-ready scripts

**Practice:**
- Built CLI-style programs using:
  - Commands (`add`, `list`, `summary`)
  - Flags (`--name`, `--age`, `--value`, etc.)
- Ensured graceful failure for incorrect CLI usage

**Key Learning Outcome:**
- Confidence in building real CLI tools
- Foundation for backend automation and GenAI pipelines
